# Exploring-India-s-Air-Pollution-with-Tableau

## Context:
Since industrialization, there has been an increasing concern about environmental pollution. As mentioned in the WHO report 7 million premature deaths annually are linked to air pollution, air pollution is the world's largest single environmental risk. 
Moreover as reported in the NY Times article, India’s Air Pollution Rivals China’s as World’s Deadliest it has been found that India's air pollution is deadlier than China's.

1. Introduction:

The purpose of this Tableau dashboard is to explore India's air pollution levels across different states and regions, aiming to understand the potential correlation between air quality changes and environmental policy shifts.
2. Dataset Overview:

The dataset is a clean version of the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data, compiled across years and states by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP).
Key dimensions include Stn_code, Sampling_Date, State, Location, Agency, location_monitoring_station, pm2_5, Date, and Type. Measures include So2, No2, Rspm, and Spm.
3. Dashboard Components:

a. Map Visualization:
- Utilizes geographical maps to visualize air quality levels across different states or regions in India.
- Color codes map markers based on the air quality index (AQI) or other relevant metrics.

b. Time Series Charts:
- Features time series line charts illustrating changes in air quality over the years.
- Groups data by months or years to identify patterns and trends.

c. Policy Change Timeline:
- Integrates a timeline component showcasing key environmental policy changes in India.
- Highlights policy change events on the timeline to observe correlations with air quality variations.

d. Filter Options:
- Implements filters for users to select specific states, periods, or pollutant types.
- Allows users to customize their views based on their interests or research questions.

e. Comparative Analysis:
- Includes comparative charts illustrating air quality comparisons between different states or regions.
- Utilizes bar charts or line charts to show variations in air quality metrics.

f. Top Pollutant Analysis:
- Identifies and displays the top pollutants contributing to poor air quality.
- Utilizes bar charts or pie charts to represent the proportion of each pollutant.

g. Insightful Annotations:
- Uses annotations to highlight specific data points, events, or trends in the analysis.
- Provides context and explanations for these annotations.

4. Steps to Build the Dashboard:

a. Connect to Data:
- Establishes a connection to the dataset, ensuring all relevant dimensions and measures are recognized.

b. Design Dashboard Layout:
- Defines the overall structure of the dashboard, allocating space for each component.

c. Create Worksheets:
- Develops individual worksheets for each visual element, incorporating appropriate charts and graphs.

d. Apply Filters:
- Implements filters to allow users to interact with the data dynamically.

e. Implement Interactivity:
- Enhances user experience by incorporating interactive features like tooltips and hover effects.

f. Timeline Integration:
- Embeds a timeline component to showcase key policy changes and their temporal correlation with air quality variations.

g. Map Integration:
- Integrates geographical maps with color-coded markers to represent air quality levels across states.
